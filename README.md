## Overview

This script generates fake student data and their grades in various subjects. It then performs some analyses on the data using NumPy.

## Usage

1. First, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python students_grades.py
    ```

## Description

- The script generates fake student data including names and random grades in subjects like Maths, English, History, Biology, and Logic.
- It calculates the average grade for each student, the highest average grade among all students, the highest and lowest grades in Maths, and identifies students with grades higher than the average in English.
- It then displays the generated data and the results of the analyses.

## File Structure

- `students_grades.py.`: The main Python script containing the code for generating fake data and performing analyses.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations and calculations.
- `tabulate`: Used to display data in a tabular format.

## Note

This script is for educational purposes and generates random data for demonstration purposes only.
